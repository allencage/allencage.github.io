Hi, I'm Alin and software engineering is what I do on a daily basis. I am based in Cluj-Napoca and my background is focused on .NET and C# Development with a background in Cross-platform applications, both mobile and desktop. I consider myself to be a good all-rounder, I have experience working on both front and back end of applications. I am a creative problem solver with experience in utilizing a variety of technologies. In my spare time, I like to test and build new things with technologies that are stable or just emerging. In this blog I will share tips and tricks with git repos about my work.

Feel free to contact me over work opportunities and interesting projects.
