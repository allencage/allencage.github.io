Ok, so I am not usually amazed by the state of other languages but this actually blew my mind.
For some time I was searching for a way to combine my love of code with the ability to somehow 
share with the world the work that I do. I tried blogger, but with no success, could not get
engaged to write at least once every few days on it. I also tried google+ but I always got
distracted about what other wrote and I couldn't properly focus on the task at hand. 

I've also considered creating my own blog using Ghost as a platform and hosting it on my pi 
but let's face it: I would need to constantly update my own hardware and try not to accidentaly
delete everything on the sd card... The simple solution: github pages with jekyll.

This was by far the easiest and the most fun I had in a while creating a static site and having
complete control over how the website looks and how the posts are maintained. And because
everything is hosted on github I can work in my preferred editor and not get lost in other 
flashy patforms. If you have not yet tried it, here are some usefull links that will help you
set up a website like this: [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] and [Github pages][github-pages]
