For some time I was searching for a simple and clear way to jot down ideas in a clear format that was not getting in the way of my work.
Because I work as a software engineer I always use vcs and some sort of text editor all the time so why not use the tools already available.
What is best about this is that I can write the posts from whatever platform because Jekyll works with simple text files. No need to actually
install anything. 

So without further ado, welcome!
